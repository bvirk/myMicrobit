### project [plotBarSTick](https://makecode.microbit.org/_WgzEqqPCVcR9)

Shows voltage input on AnalogPin.P0. The reading is presented as a 25 leds stick, starting from bottom right corner and twisted at left for continueing at above row's right side. From 0 to 3.3.v is shown respectively as from no led's to all 25 led's lightening.  

The measurement appears one of following ways

1. PWM signal to a servo - positive signal of 1-2 ms length every 20ms
2. PWM signal, which 20ms time period dutycycle can be cnged fra nearly  0 to almost n√¶sten 100
3. No signal - output low.

### Project [binClock](https://makecode.microbit.org/_LCHfvVM7pJYP)

Binary clock - the led rows shows, counting from top

1. hours
2. tens of minuts
3. ones of minuts
4. tens of seconds
5. ones of seconds
